# Planner

If getting there is half the fun, planning is part of which half?

## JavaScript Client

I recently revived this long-forgotten project by upgrading the client, and Ember.js project, to the latest Ember-CLI, Ember, Ember Data and component libraries.

The client API is currently being faked by Pretender.

## Server for content and client API

Somewhat TBD, though looking seriously at Phoenix and Elixir to do the MVP implementation.
